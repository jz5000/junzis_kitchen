    <p>I'd love to share my <em>cooking journey</em> with you!</p>
    <h2>Recipes</h2>
    <h3>Chinese cooking</h3>
    <p><em>C1: Easy pickling in a 3 gal crock pot</em></p>
    <h4>Makes 18 cups brine (for 5 lbs of vegetables)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>18 cups (144 fl oz) water</li>
      <li>252 g kosher or sea salt (14 grams per cup of water)</li>
      <li>
        10 tablespoons (5 fl oz) sake, gin or vodka (about 1/2 Tbsp per cup)
      </li>
      <li>84 g white sugar (about 1 tsp per cup)</li>
      <li>fresh, peeled ginger slices</li>
      <li>Sichuan peppercorns, black peppercorns, bay leaf</li>
      <li>
        hard, non-watery vegetables such as cabbage, white or red radish,
        carrot, celery, cauliflower, long beans or green beans, fresh chilies,
        etc. (not cucumbers; they should be pickled on their own)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Instructions:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Bring water to a boil and remove from heat. Add salt and sugar and stir
        to dissolve. Let cool to room temperature, and add liquor. You can
        refrigerate to speed up the process. Taste the brine to make sure the
        taste is pleasing to you and adjust accordingly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Store the jar in a cool, dark place such as a pantry or cupboard to
        ferment. It's important to not let the moat go dry. Add water every few
        days as it evaporates to keep moat about half-way full. Sample the
        vegetables every day or two to check their sourness. Use clean
        chopsticks or long-handled spoon to remove vegetables, as your hands can
        contaminate the ferment. Top off brine if it is not above the
        vegetables. Cabbage can take as little as 1 day, while green beans and
        other vegetables take 5 to 7 days or longer, depending on the size of
        the vegetables, the room temperature and the desired sourness. Expect
        the vegetables to lose their bright colors as they ferment, but not
        their crunch or taste!
      </li>
      <li>
        When the brine begins to bubble, turns cloudy and takes on the color of
        the vegetables in it, then you know that fermentation has started. If
        using a larger jar or pickle crock, monitor it for the white yeast film
        that can occur naturally on the surface in lacto-fermentation and remove
        any that occurs. As you use the pickles, replenish the crock with more
        salt water, liquor, seasonings and vegetables. Reuse the brine for as
        long as it tastes fresh and pleasing. Sichuan picklers can keep a brine
        going for years!
